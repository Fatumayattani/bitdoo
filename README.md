# 💸 Bitdoo  
**Decentralized Bitcoin microloans for the unbanked — powered by ICP’s Chain Fusion**  

Bitdoo is a **trustless P2P lending platform** that connects global borrowers and lenders using Bitcoin smart contracts on the Internet Computer. No banks. No predatory fees. Just borderless financial access.  

🌐 **Live Demo:** [https://bitdoo.xyz](https://bitdoo.xyz) | 📌 **Mission:** *Democratize credit with programmable Bitcoin*

## 🌍 The Problem  
Over 1.4 billion people lack access to basic financial services. Traditional microfinance fails them with:  
- 🏦 **Centralized gatekeeping** (slow approvals, geographic exclusion)  
- 💰 **Exploitative rates** (avg. 30%+ APR in developing markets)  
- 📉 **Opacity** (borrowers can’t verify terms, lenders can’t audit flows)  

**Bitdoo solves this** by replacing middlemen with ICP smart contracts and Bitcoin’s censorship-resistant money.

## ⚡ How Bitdoo Works  
### For Borrowers  
1️⃣ **Request a loan** – Set amount, term, and purpose (e.g., "$500 for farm supplies, 6 months")  
2️⃣ **Get funded** – Lenders worldwide compete to fund your request  
3️⃣ **Repay via BTC** – Automated schedule with on-chain transparency  

### For Lenders  
1️⃣ **Browse vetted loans** – Filter by risk score, location, or category  
2️⃣ **Fund securely** – BTC held in ICP smart contract escrow  
3️⃣ **Earn yield** – Collect repayments + interest (no late fees – enforced by code)  

**Tech backbone:**  
- 🛡️ ICP canisters manage escrow/reputation (Motoko)  
- ⛓️ Native Bitcoin integration via Chain Fusion  
- 📱 Mobile-first UX for low-bandwidth users

## 🚀 Why This Matters  
| Bitdoo | Traditional Microfinance |  
|--------|--------------------------|  
| 1-10% APR | 30-200% APR |  
| 5-min approval | Weeks of paperwork |
